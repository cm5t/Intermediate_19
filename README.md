# ðŸ’¸ Saving Urgency Predictor â€“ Building Blocs 2025 (I19)
# By Dylan, Chandi, Kanish and Adithya
## This is a Streamlit-based web app that predicts how urgently a family needs to save based on income and expenditure data. It uses machine learning (Random Forest + Linear Regression) and provides actionable financial advice for Singaporean households.

---

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Techniques Used


- **Random Forest Classifier** with 500 trees
- **Feature Importance** graph
- Visualized **Decision Tree**
- **Linear Regression** as exploratory analysis
- Trained on real Filipino household expenditure data
- Suggests subsidies and support based on Singapore government schemes like the MOE FAS and the CHAS Blue/Orange.

### Importing Libraries
### You need to install Python version 3.8+. Then, type 'pip install (streamlit/pandas/numpy/scikit-learn/matplotlib/joblib)' (install all of them). 

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cm5t/buildingblocs25.git
cd buildingblocs25
```

Make sure Cleaned_Family_Data.csv is in the same folder as main.py, and that there is a folder called 'pages'.

# Project Structure:
```bash
