    Our group decided to create a Machine Learning Model that predicts the urgency of saving for families based on their income, expenditure and other data. The model is trained on a dataset that includes various financial metrics, such as household income, food expenditure, transportation costs, and more.
    ### We used a Random Forest Algorithm, with 100s of if-else statements to predict whether the family requires saving.
    This can be applied in the Singapore Context, and worldwide as well!
    ### The saving tiers are as follows:
    ### 0: "âœ… No urgency â€“ You're doing great!",
    ### 1: "ðŸŸ¢ Low urgency â€“ Consider saving a little more.",
    ### 2: "ðŸŸ¡ Moderate urgency â€“ Watch your expenses.",
    ### 3: "ðŸŸ  High urgency â€“ Plan carefully.",
    ### 4: "ðŸ”´ Very high urgency â€“ Income just covers needs.",
    ### 5: "ðŸš¨ Critical â€“ You need to reduce expenses and quickly increase income!"
